        <h2 class="heading">Why conserve energy: <span>8 benefits of energy efficiency</span><span class="animate scroll" style="--i:1;"></span></h2>

  
          <p  style="font-size: 18px;">  Conserving energy comes with a bunch of cool perks that make life better for everyone. First off, it's like a secret stash of extra cash—using less energy means smaller bills, leaving more money in your pocket for all the fun stuff. Plus, there's the feel-good factor; being part of the energy-saving team is like having your own superhero cape. More than that, saving energy is a gift to our planet. It keeps the air we breathe fresh, the water we drink clear, and the weather not too wild. And guess what? Your gadgets will thank you too! Using less energy means they stick around for longer, and we don't have to make new ones as often. 
            </p>
            <h2 class="headings" style="text-align: left;">1. Protect The environment. <span></span><span class="animate scroll" style="--i:2;"></span></h2>
            <p class="benefits" style="font-size: 18px;"> Energy efficiency is a great way to reduce your carbon footprint. Homes were responsible for 19 percent of national greenhouse gas emissions in 2016, and implementing energy efficiency measures in your home can significantly reduce your emissions contribution. The typical household can reduce its energy use (and, by extension, its greenhouse gas emissions) by 25 to 30 percent by investing in more efficient energy consumption.</p>
            <h2 class="headings" style="text-align: left;">2. Significantly reduce your utility bills.<span></span><span class="animate scroll" style="--i:2;"></span></h2>
            <p class="benefits" style="font-size: 18px;"> As a homeowner, energy costs can make up a significant portion of your recurring monthly expenses. With energy-efficient appliances and home upgrades, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that you can save anywhere from five to 30 percent on your utility bills. Energy-efficient appliances consume less energy throughout their service lives without sacrificing quality and are an excellent way to save on energy expenditures.</p>



<h2 class="headings" style="text-align: left;">3. Earn a great return on your investment.<span></span><span class="animate scroll" style="--i:2;"></span></h2>

<p class="benefits" style="font-size: 18px;"> Energy efficient purchases should not be viewed as an expense but as an investment with utility savings that add up over the product's service life. Savings can offset the initial price premium on energy-efficient options and offer a significant return compared to conventional, non-efficient alternatives. Furthermore, the return you pocket through savings will only increase over time as energy prices continue to rise in the United States.</p>


<h2 class="headings" style="text-align: left;">4. Increase your property value   <span></span><span class="animate scroll" style="--i:2;"></span></h2>

<p class="benefits" style="font-size: 18px;"> In the real estate market, energy-efficient homes frequently sell for a higher price than standard homes with comparable features. Every project that increases your home’s energy efficiency adds a fraction of its cost to the final selling price. In addition, private residences with green certifications have been proven to sell at a premium compared to similar homes in the area. With expectations of reduced utility bills and fewer repair bills, energy efficiency is an attractive feature in any home.</p>



<h2 class="headings" style="text-align: left;">5. Enhance your quality of life<span></span><span class="animate scroll" style="--i:2;"></span></h2>

<p class="benefits" style="font-size: 18px;"> By optimizing your energy use, you can increase the comfort of living in your home and, in many cases, see notable health benefits. When you conduct energy-efficient measures, your home will be warmer, drier, and adequately ventilated, which lowers the risk of illnesses and mold growth. Energy efficiency also prevents the buildup of indoor pollutants, a significant concern in areas with high radon emissions. The financial benefits of energy-efficient buildings yield a benefit-cost ratio of over 4 to 1, and 75 percent of those benefits can be attributed to health advantages</p>

    <h2 class="headings" style="text-align: left;">6. Energy savings tips help you easily cut costs<span></span><span class="animate scroll" style="--i:2;"></span></h2>

<p class="benefits" style="font-size: 18px;"> Energy expenses are often thought of as a fixed cost of owning a home or business, with reductions only possible through pricey renovations. However, you can easily reduce your utility bills through simple energy conservation behaviors or small energy-efficient purchases. Programmable thermostats, advanced power strips, and energy-efficient lighting can decrease your energy expenses with almost no effort on your part.</p>

    <h2 class="headings" style="text-align: left;">7. Earn incremental returns on energy efficiency investments<span></span><span class="animate scroll" style="--i:2;"></span></h2>

<p class="benefits" style="font-size: 18px;"> Energy efficiency measures, no matter how small, are capable of generating utility savings over their service lives. However, your savings are usually proportionate to the cost of the energy-efficient upgrade – replacing light bulbs will only cost a few dollars but will deliver marginal savings, while upgrading your attic insulation can save hundreds of dollars in heating and cooling bills. Upgrades can range from simply plugging in a smart power strip to an HVAC system overhaul. How little or how much you choose to invest in energy efficiency is entirely up to you.</p>


            
<h2 class="headings" style="text-align: left;">8. Insulate yourself from rising electricity prices <span></span><span class="animate scroll" style="--i:2;"></span></h2>
   

    <p class="benefits" style="font-size: 18px;"> Utility residential electricity rates fluctuate seasonally and annually but have risen steadily in the last decade. This trend is likely to continue into the future. In addition to cutting your monthly electricity bills now, conducting energy efficiency improvements on your home helps to insulate you from the financial impact of unpredictable sharp energy price increases that could happen in the years to come. </p>

            <img class="bee" src="https://i.postimg.cc/XJYKRWQW/NMEEE-1.jpg"/><br>
The Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) was launched by the Ministry of Power for new commercial buildings in 2007. It sets minimum energy standards for new commercial buildings.

To promote a market pull for energy-efficient buildings, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency developed a voluntary Star Rating Programme for buildings which is based on the actual performance of a building.
The updated version of ECBC came in 2017 which sets parameters for builders, designers, and architects to integrate renewable energy sources in building design with the inclusion of passive design strategies. The code aims to optimize energy savings with the comfort levels for occupants and prefers life-cycle cost-effectiveness to achieve energy neutrality in commercial buildings.

<img class="bee" src=""/>


<p  style="font-size: 18px;"> 
    The National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) is one of the eight missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). NMEEE aims to strengthen the market for energy efficiency by creating conducive regulatory and policy regimes and has envisaged fostering innovative and sustainable business models in the energy efficiency sector.

    The NMEEE has four initiatives to enhance energy efficiency in energy-intensive industries which are as follows:

<br><br>

<ol>
    <li style="font-size: 20px; color: coral;">Perform, Achieve, and Trade Scheme (PAT):</li>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">A market-based mechanism to enhance the cost-effectiveness in improving Energy Efficiency in Energy Intensive industries through certification of energy saving which can be traded.

    Units that can achieve a specific energy consumption (SEC) level that is lower than their targets can receive energy savings certificates (ESCerts) for their excess savings.
    
    The ESCerts could be traded on the Power Exchanges and bought by other units under PAT who can use them to meet their compliance requirements.</p>

    <li style="font-size: 20px; color: coral;">Market Transformation for Energy Efficiency (MTEE):</li>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Under MTEE, two programs have been developed i.e. Bachat Lamp Yojana(BLY) and Super-Efficient Equipment Programme (SEEP).

        BEE promotes the use of LED lights using the institutional structure of the BLY Programme. SEEP is a program designed to bring accelerated market transformation for super-efficient appliances by providing financial stimulus innovatively at critical point/s of intervention.
        </p>
        <li style="font-size: 20px; color: coral;">Energy Efficiency Financing Platform (EEFP):</li>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">   This is a platform for the creation of mechanisms that would help finance demand-side management programs in all sectors by capturing future energy savings. Under this, MoUs have been signed with financial institutions to work together for the development of the energy efficiency market and the identification of issues related to this market development.
    </p>
    <li style="font-size: 20px; color: coral;">Framework for Energy Efficient Economic Development (FEEED):Market Transformation for Energy Efficiency (MTEE):</li>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;"> This is for the development of fiscal instruments to promote energy efficiency. Under this two initiatives are taken:
        <br><br>
        <b>Partial Risk Guarantee Fund for Energy Efficiency (PRGFEE)</b> is risk risk-sharing mechanism to provide commercial banks with a partial coverage of risk involved in extending loans for energy efficiency projects.
        <br><br>
        <b>The Venture Capital Fund for Energy Efficiency (VCFEE)</b> is a fund to provide equity capital for energy efficiency projects. The support under VCFEE is limited to Government buildings and municipalities.





</ol>
